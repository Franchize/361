			<h3> About Me </h3>
<br>
<br>
				<p>	I was born and raised in Evanston, Il, which is located just North of Chiago. I' am a senior at Illinois Institute of Technology majoring
				in Informtion Technology and Management with a specializtion in entrepreneurship and web development. I'am persuing a career
				as an entrepreneur that helps companies grow and transistion their digital precesence in their respective market place. My skillset
				ranges from product/business model and web development (HTML, CSS, javascript, and JQuery), design thinking, and UX design. My goal is to
				start a digital media firm called *The Shakur Group*. The Shakur Group will work with small to mid-sized companies to enhance thier digital precesence to
				standout from thier competition. This discipline and area of service is multi-fascit and will take several years to shape, focus, and refine my service.
				In addition to working with companies, I seek to work with grassroot community focused organzations. I have a passion for empowering deprieved people and will
				provide my services for free.
				</p>
<br>
				<p>	The career path that I'am forging down is not the straight and narrow and will lack financial security in the beginning stages of development.
				Therefore, I will be day and trend trading to earn money. Trading stocks is very risky but is suitable and right for my career path because of the financial freedom
				that can be attand.
